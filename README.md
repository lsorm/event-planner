# event-planner
The EventPlanner program allows the user to enter a convention's event details and save it to a file.
The file would ideally be the name of the convention (nycc.txt)
The user has a choice of Autograph, PhotoOp, Panel, Exclusive, or Other when entering an event within the convention.
